build an iterator based benchmark

Processing Primitives:

- Map
- Fold

- Parallel Pipeline
    - Fork -> Map -> Join  / Fork -> Map_1 -> Rearrange -> Map_2 -> Join
    - !implement at least map and fold
    - !tag events with sequenceNr - ? overhead vs. ease of use
    - see impl at https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/

- Stateful Processing
    - a secial case of Fold with an output stream
    - state sampling / "pull()" - howto sync on parallel pipelines
    - select context by key - !integrate selector with Fork / Rearrange
